My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a life line. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it not yet finished) and has been a great way of keeping on course dedicated and motivated.  Yesterday three months after starting the course and honestly to my surprise I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work for being such a dedicated teacher and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has literally been life changing. <strong> With gratitude  Laura"</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 76 hours long.  <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.   Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly the course is designed as a one stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).  The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate advanced and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.  JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.  So you could skip that section entirely.  But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces then the content is there and ready for you.   And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java then you can go through the entire course if you wish but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>Why would you choose to learn Java?</strong></p><p>The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.  It's in the hundreds.  Why would you choose the Java language?</p><p>The number one reason is its popularity.  According to many official websites that track popularity of languages Java is either #1 or in the top 3.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use.  Java came out in the 1990's and is still very popular today.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language but thats not necessarily the case with Java.</p><p>Until recently Java releases were infrequent (one major release in 3 years was common).  Companies standardised on specific versions of Java.  Right now most companies are still focused on Java 8 which is a relatively old version dating back to 2015.</p><p>Oracle (the owners of Java) are now releasing new versions of Java every six months and when the new version comes out the old version is no longer supported.</p><p>But to cater for most companies who tend to stick to specific versions of Java for a long time they have marked the current version of Java - Java 11 as LTS - or Long Term support. That means that they guarantee to support this version for the long term - for a number of years at least.</p><p>Companies will stick to versions of Java that are supported in the long term. For career purposes you should learn the appropriate versions of Java that your future employer will likely be using.  Right now thats Java 8 and Java 11 (Java 9 and Java 10 have been released and already been marked obsolete and are no longer supported).<br><br>The good news is that this course is focused on Java 8 and has recently been updated for Java 11.  <br><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  Core Java is the fundamental parts of the java jdk (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best seller since it's release on Udemy you would be joining over 260000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are close to 60000 reviews left by students.  It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff as well as thick college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you they were tired of low-quality lessons poorly explained topics and all-round confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts like showing you the free tools you need to download and install to writing your very first Java program.  You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours and if you choose to can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords operators statements and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse NetBeans or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development the Spring framework Java EE (Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.  That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept programming term and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book you’ll use your own creativity to make unique intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept and it works. </p><p>As your instructor I have over <strong>35 years experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000.

My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a life line. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it not yet finished) and has been a great way of keeping on course dedicated and motivated.  Yesterday three months after starting the course and honestly to my surprise I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work for being such a dedicated teacher and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has literally been life changing. <strong> With gratitude  Laura"</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 76 hours long.  <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.   Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly the course is designed as a one stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).  The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate advanced and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.  JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.  So you could skip that section entirely.  But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces then the content is there and ready for you.   And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java then you can go through the entire course if you wish but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>Why would you choose to learn Java?</strong></p><p>The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.  It's in the hundreds.  Why would you choose the Java language?</p><p>The number one reason is its popularity.  According to many official websites that track popularity of languages Java is either #1 or in the top 3.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use.  Java came out in the 1990's and is still very popular today.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language but thats not necessarily the case with Java.</p><p>Until recently Java releases were infrequent (one major release in 3 years was common).  Companies standardised on specific versions of Java.  Right now most companies are still focused on Java 8 which is a relatively old version dating back to 2015.</p><p>Oracle (the owners of Java) are now releasing new versions of Java every six months and when the new version comes out the old version is no longer supported.</p><p>But to cater for most companies who tend to stick to specific versions of Java for a long time they have marked the current version of Java - Java 11 as LTS - or Long Term support. That means that they guarantee to support this version for the long term - for a number of years at least.</p><p>Companies will stick to versions of Java that are supported in the long term. For career purposes you should learn the appropriate versions of Java that your future employer will likely be using.  Right now thats Java 8 and Java 11 (Java 9 and Java 10 have been released and already been marked obsolete and are no longer supported).<br><br>The good news is that this course is focused on Java 8 and has recently been updated for Java 11.  <br><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  Core Java is the fundamental parts of the java jdk (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best seller since it's release on Udemy you would be joining over 260000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are close to 60000 reviews left by students.  It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff as well as thick college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you they were tired of low-quality lessons poorly explained topics and all-round confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts like showing you the free tools you need to download and install to writing your very first Java program.  You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours and if you choose to can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords operators statements and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse NetBeans or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development the Spring framework Java EE (Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.  That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept programming term and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book you’ll use your own creativity to make unique intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept and it works. </p><p>As your instructor I have over <strong>35 years experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes over 18 years <em>(I’ve taught students younger than that)</em>. Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity but I can make it fun too!</p><p>It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...</p><p><strong>See what your fellow students have to say:</strong></p><p>"This course was a guiding light in my "Becoming a developer" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error.

New more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em> meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br><br>A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once and never get updated.  Learning an older version of Java can be counter productive - you could will be learning the "old way" of doing things rather than using current technology.<br><br>Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.  <br><br>That’s why I’m always adding new up-to-date content to this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong>.
